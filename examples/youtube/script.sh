export WHISPER_MODEL=Systran/faster-distil-whisper-large-v3 # or Systran/faster-whisper-tiny.en if you are running on a CPU for a faster inference.

# Ensure you have `faster-whisper-server` running. If this is your first time running it expect to wait up-to a minute for the model to be downloaded and loaded into memory. You can run `curl localhost:8000/health` to check if the server is ready or watch the logs with `docker logs -f <container_id>`.

# Download the audio from a YouTube video. In this example I'm downloading "The Evolution of the Operating System" by Asionometry YouTube channel. I highly checking this channel out, the guy produces very high content. If you don't have `youtube-dl`, you'll have to install it. https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl

# Make a request to the API to transcribe the audio. The response will be streamed to the terminal and saved to a file. The video is 30 minutes long, so it might take a while to transcribe, especially if you are running this on a CPU. `Systran/faster-distil-whisper-large-v3` takes ~30 seconds on Nvidia L4. `Systran/faster-whisper-tiny.en` takes ~1 minute on Ryzen 7 7700X. The .txt file in the example was transcribed using `Systran/faster-distil-whisper-large-v3`.
